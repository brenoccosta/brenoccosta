- Hi, I’m @brenoccosta (or Breno Coltro)
- I’m interested in environment, physics, astronomy, mental and physical health, philosophy/spirituality and History (my former area); above all else, however, matters to me the need to contribute in meaningful ways to society and promote changes in everyday life.
- I’m currently learning data science (in early beginnings...)
	- Currently I've managed  only to learn Python and have some  knowledge in several data science related packages, as well I've made LOTS of plots and analysis.
	- Some experience in statistical evaluation and in KDD process.
- I’m looking for opportunities to develop my skills in any of the mentioned areas above, with or without formal commitment.
- Feel free to contact me through here (GitHub).

Among my previous non-related with programming experiences (such as in History), I've  teached, studied Bronze Age Aegean and Eastern Mediterrean Sea societies and cultural interchanges, such as the role of violence and how it embedded Dark Age Greece's heroes and deities, being *Iliad* my main document, as long many other ancient texts related to the theme.
