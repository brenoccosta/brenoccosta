- Hi, I’m @brenoccosta (or Breno Coltro)
- I’m interested in environment, physics, astronomy, mental and physical health and History (my former area); above all else, however, matters to me the need to contribute in meaningful ways to society and promote changes.
- I’m currently learning data science (in early beginnings...)
- I’m looking for opportunities to develop my skills in any of the mentioned areas above, with or without formal commitment.
- Feel free to contact me through here (GitHub).
